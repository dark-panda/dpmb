= DarkPandaMediaBrowser

This little Rails project is just a simple media browser. If you want to use
it for anything serious, you might be nuts, but if you want a simple media
browser you can start with a couple of simple Rails commands, then maybe this
is the media browser for you. I would definitely not recommend using it in
a public context, but as a private media browser, it'll do in a pinch.
